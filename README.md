# MAGI Strategic Advisor

A modular, harness-engineered skill package providing multi-perspective strategic decision analysis powered by the MAGI three-wise-man decision framework.

Inspired by the MAGI supercomputer system from Neon Genesis Evangelion, this project implements three independent decision cores that produce high-quality judgments through voting and deliberation:

- **MELCHIOR** -- The rational-scientist persona: data-driven, logic-first analysis
- **BALTHASAR** -- The prudent-guardian persona: risk-averse, bottom-line-oriented analysis
- **CASPER** -- The intuitive-observer persona: holistic, pattern-recognition analysis

---

## Features

- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Every decision is examined through three independent lenses (rational, prudent, intuitive)
- **Structured decision matrices**: Quantitative scoring with weighted dimensions and veto conditions
- **Risk assessment**: Six-domain risk scanning with probability-impact matrix and severity classification
- **Multi-option comparison**: Systematic side-by-side evaluation of competing proposals
- **Modular architecture**: Each component is independently testable with defined interfaces (harness engineering)
- **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md provides routing; detailed content loads on demand
- **Dual-mode prompts**: User-facing prompts portable to any AI conversation window
- **Executable tools**: Python scripts for weighted scoring and risk matrix generation
- **Open source**: Licensed under GNU GPL V3

## Quick Start

### For AI Agents

1. Read `README FOR AI.md` -- this is the authoritative build instruction
2. Follow the Generation Workflow (Section 8) to generate the complete project
3. Run validation checks to ensure all constraints are satisfied

### For Human Users

1. Clone this repository
2. Explore the `scripts/` directory for executable tools:
   - `python scripts/weighted-scoring.py` -- Run weighted scoring with sample data
   - `python scripts/risk-matrix-gen.py` -- Generate risk matrix (terminal output)
   - `python scripts/risk-matrix-gen.py --html` -- Generate HTML risk matrix visualization
   - `python scripts/risk-matrix-gen.py --json` -- Output risk data in JSON format
3. Use the `prompts/` files by copying them into any AI conversation window

### For Contributors

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
2. Follow the coding standards and commit conventions
3. Submit pull requests after ensuring all constraints are satisfied

## Design Principles

This project adheres to five core design principles:

1. **Standardized**: Consistent formatting, naming, and structure across all files
2. **Generic**: No domain-specific assumptions; parameterized thresholds and weights
3. **Modular**: Each file has a single responsibility; modules are independently testable
4. **Compact**: No redundant information; SKILL.md under 120 lines
5. **Automated**: Scripts include CLI interfaces; validation can be automated

---

## Hard Constraints

The project enforces eight hard constraints (HC-01 through HC-08) covering language requirements (English only), emoji prohibition, SKILL.md size limits, code placement rules, prompt portability, harness engineering, design principles, and license requirements. See `README FOR AI.md` Section 1 for full details.
